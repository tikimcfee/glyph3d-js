  Migrates Mojo code off legacy parametric closures (`capturing[_]`,
  `@__parameter` / `@parameter`, `api[fn](args)`) onto value-taking unified
  closures (`api(args, fn)` with `{imm}` / `{mut}` / `{var}` / named capture
  lists). Use when removing parametric overloads, fixing "capturing thin"
  conversion errors, rewriting nested launch/callback closures, or migrating
  any API that took a comptime function parameter.

# Closure migration

Migrate callers **before** deleting parametric overloads. Prefer value-taking
APIs with unified closures. Pair with `mojo-syntax` (and
`mojo-gpu-fundamentals` for GPU launch code).

## Forbidden

**Hard ban — do not under any circumstance** add `@__parameter` / `@parameter`
to a nested closure to persist, introduce, or paper over a legacy closure.
Not as a migration bridge, not to satisfy a still-capturing API, not to
“borrow imm”, not behind a thin `*_value` wrapper. That is forbidden.

| Do not | Do instead |
|--------|------------|
| `@__parameter` / `@parameter` on nested defs | Unified `def … {imm}:` / `{mut x, imm}:` / named captures |
| `@__parameter` body + `*_value` forwarder | Make the body unified; pass it as a value |
| `@__parameter` “imm borrow” helper | File-scope / normal function with an imm parameter |
| `@__copy_capture(x)` on a nested closure | Named `{var x}` (copy into storage). Other names stay `{imm}` / `{mut y, imm}` |
| Keep `@__parameter` because an API is still `capturing[_]` / comptime `fn` | Migrate or widen that API to value-taking; do not paper over it |
| Wrap a `MutUntrackedOrigin` / `MutAnyOrigin` ptr in a new `DeviceBuffer` so memset or a launch “doesn’t alias” | Pass the original `DeviceBuffer` as an imm argument (`enqueue_memset` takes imm) |
| Hoist `comptime if` arm buffers / `TileTensor`s to function scope (size-1 placeholders on other arms) | Keep them in the arm; define the unified closure next to those locals |
| Rebuild `a_shape` / layouts inside the timed `call_fn` | Build once in the helper body; `{imm}`-capture |

If a callee still only accepts a comptime `capturing[_]` function parameter,
use a nested `def … capturing -> T` **without** `@__parameter` when that is
what the type requires, or **change that API** (or leave the call site
unmigrated). Never put `@__parameter` on the caller.

`@__copy_capture(x)` becomes `{var x}` on unified closures. That does **not**
convert to a `capturing thin` callee such as `elementwise_compute_lambda_type`,
and a capture list is not parsed on a `capturing` def. Until that API is
migrated off `capturing`, form the `LayoutTensor` on the host from an imm
`residual_buf` parameter and keep `@__copy_capture(residual_lt)` on
`def … capturing` (no `@__parameter`). Never call `DeviceBuffer` methods
inside the GPU epilogue.

## Target shapes

| Legacy | Preferred |
|--------|-----------|
| `api[fn](a, b)` | `api(a, fn, b)` |
| Comptime param `fn: def(...) raises capturing[_] -> None` | `FuncType: def(...) raises -> None` + runtime `ref func: FuncType` (or `func: FuncType`) |
| Nested `@__parameter` / `@parameter` def | Unified `def ...(…) raises {imm}:` / `{mut buf, imm}:` / named captures |

`@__parameter` nested defs type as `capturing thin` and do **not** convert to
a unified `FuncType`. Call rewrite alone is not enough — change how the
closure is declared (and never re-add `@__parameter`).

## Checklist

1. Inventory: `rg 'api_name\[' --glob '*.mojo'` and `rg '@__parameter|@parameter' --glob '*.mojo'`
2. Rewrite calls: `api[fn](a, b)` → `api(a, fn, b)`
3. On every nested closure in scope: drop `@__parameter` / `@parameter` /
   `@__copy_capture`; add a capture list. Each `@__copy_capture(x)` name
   becomes `{var x}` — do not imm-capture that local instead.
4. If a callee still needs a comptime capturing param → migrate that API first
   (or leave the call site unmigrated); **do not** keep `@__parameter` on the
   caller
5. Delete parametric overloads only after callers typecheck
6. Update skills/docs that still teach the legacy path
7. Typecheck: `mojo build --emit llvm <file> -o /tmp/x.ll` (filters Metal noise)
8. Self-check: `rg '@__parameter|@parameter' --glob '<touched>.mojo'` → zero on
   nested closures you own
9. NFC self-check: allocation sites, comptime vs `Coord(IndexList)` layouts, and
   timed `call_fn` bodies match the pre-migration code except capture lists and
   `api[fn](…)` → `api(…, fn, …)`. No new `.as_unsafe_any_origin()` /
   `unsafe_origin_cast` / `DeviceBuffer(…, some.ptr, owning=False)` used to
   dodge aliasing

## Capture choice

| Default / symptom | Choice |
|-------------------|--------|
| Read-only use of outer state | `{imm}` (capture-all) — **not** if the body calls `offset_ptr` or builds a mut `TileTensor` (see freeze note below) |
| Mutates some outer state; also reads `Int` / other register-passable values | `{mut buf, imm}` — **not** capture-all `{mut}` |
| Mutates several outer names | `{mut a, mut b, imm}` |
| Needs ownership / move, or replacing `@__copy_capture(x)` | `{var x}` (named copy). `{var}` capture-all only when every capture should be owned |
| Named precision only | `{mut count}`, `{imm buf, imm shape}` |
| No free runtime captures | `{}` |
| `Could not infer capture convention` | Add `{imm}` / `{mut name, imm}` / named list |
| `expression must be mutable in assignment` on a capture | That name needs `mut` (or declare temporary view arrays locally inside the closure if rebuilt per iteration) |
| `register passible value … can not be captured by 'mut'` | Capture-all `{mut}` pulled in an `Int` (etc.) — use `{mut buf, imm}` |
| `.mut … is 'False' but … is 'True'` on `.unsafe_ptr()` / `TileTensor` | Buffer captured `{imm}` — `{mut out_buf, imm}`; do **not** paper over with `unsafe_mut_cast` |
| `'lit.call' op callee expected call argument #0` on `offset_ptr` / similar | `{imm}` froze the buffer used as `self` — `{mut cb_a, mut cb_b, …, imm}` |
| `cannot bind an RValue to a reference` on `bench_func` | `kernel_launch` nested inside `bench_func` with `@__copy_capture` — define `kernel_launch` at outer function scope and remove `@__copy_capture` from `bench_func` |
| `expected ':' in function definition` at `raises {…}` | Capture list on an `@__parameter` def — strip `@__parameter` and keep the list |
| `aliasing values passed immutably…mutably` / note names `origin_of(buf)` | Closure struct would hold fields that alias the same origin, one mut and one imm — see **Aliasing** below |
| `aliasing … origin_of(n)` on an `Int` (or other register-passable) local | `@__copy_capture(n)` became an imm ref to `var n`. Use `{var n}` (copy). Do not delete `n` and rewire to another `Int` unless that is smaller |
| `aliasing values passed mutably to 'x' … and passed mutably to 'y'` | Two mut captures of the same origin (view + backing buffer, or a value plus a nested helper that also captures it) — see **Aliasing** below |
| `cannot bind an RValue to a reference` on `bencher_iter_custom` value call | Value-taking `bencher_iter_custom` declared with `ref func: FuncType` rejecting temporary/lifted closure value — take `func: FuncType` by value |
| `'lit.call' op invalid symbol use` / `origin<false>` vs `origin<true>` on `bench_function[fn]` | `@__parameter` capturing-thin `bench_fn` captured unified `{imm}` children — drop `@__parameter`; `bench_function(fn, id, …)` value-taking |
| `two_launch` in `_dispatch_ag_norm` / `capturing` params | If an outer API still accepts a comptime `capturing` function parameter, write `def two_launch() raises capturing:` without `@__parameter` or capture lists |
| `cannot capture … not copyable` / not a parameter reference | `{imm}` if possible; else `{var}` / named `var x`; never `@__parameter` |
| Memset / launch aliases with a wrapper whose ptr is already `MutUntrackedOrigin` | Pass the original `DeviceBuffer` as an imm argument. Do **not** wrap the untracked ptr |

Do **not** use capture-all `{mut}` when the closure also mentions register-passable
outer values (`Int`, indices, lengths). Mix an explicit `mut` name with a
trailing default `imm` (`{mut tt_in, imm}`). At most one bare convention
(`imm` / `mut` / `var`) may appear as the default for unlisted captures.

`{imm}` **freezes** captured buffers. That is wrong whenever the body:

- writes an output (`TileTensor` / `.unsafe_ptr()` where `mut=True` is required), or
- calls a method that internally does `self._buf.unsafe_ptr()` then
  `unsafe_mut_cast[True]()` — `CacheBustingBuffer.offset_ptr` is the usual
  case. The method may be declared `self` (imm); the captured field still
  fails to match (`lit.call` argument #0). Mut-capture every such buffer
  (`{mut cb_a, mut cb_b, mut cb_c, mut cb_a_scales, mut cb_b_scales, imm}`).

Do **not** “fix” this with extra `unsafe_mut_cast` (the method already has
that) or by restoring `@__parameter`. Only skip `mut` when that would create
an aliasing pair with another captured field of the same origin (see below).

### Aliasing

When several captured / nested values reference the **same origin** and one of
them is mutable, the closure struct would contain aliasing fields. Two captures
that alias the same memory are permitted only when **both are read-only**.

`@__copy_capture(n)` on a register-passable local (`Int` index, length, row
count) becomes `{var n}` — a copy into closure storage. `{imm}` of
`var n = …` is a reference to that mutable local and aliases once a unified
sibling embeds `origin_of(n)`. Use `{var n}`. Do not delete `n` or wrap the
function just for that integer.

Prefer, in order:

1. **Capture as read (`imm`)** whenever the body does not actually mutate that
   origin. Drop `{mut …}`; pass an imm parameter. `enqueue_memset` takes an
   imm `DeviceBuffer`. A helper that only reads `config.rank_units` must not
   mut-capture `config`. Prefer this also when an outer `var buf` stays
   mutable while a nested unified closure would capture a view of `buf`: call a
   **normal function** (file-scope or otherwise non-capturing) that takes
   `buf: DeviceBuffer[…]` as an imm parameter, and form the launch there.
2. **Disassemble the instance** so origin tags are finer-grained. If the
   compiler treats two uses as overlapping because they capture a whole object
   (a `config`, a struct, a `List` of buffers) but the mutation does not
   actually touch the other use's memory, pull out the fields you need (e.g.
   hoist `rank_units` / `rank_unit_start` into `Array[Int, ngpus]`) and capture
   or pass those instead of the parent.
3. **Pass the mutable origin as an argument** (`mut buf: …` in the parameter
   list) so it is not a captured field. Lift **only** the capture that must
   be mut and still aliases another use — read-only captures can stay
   captures. When the value-taking API's `FuncType` is fixed, use a thin
   `{mut buf, imm}` adapter that only forwards `buf` into the all-imm body.
   Prefer widening the API when practical.

Do **not** “fix” aliasing by erasing the origin. That includes
`.as_unsafe_any_origin()`, `unsafe_origin_cast[MutUntrackedOrigin]` /
`MutAnyOrigin` on the original buffer, and wrapping an already-untracked
pointer (`EPLocalSyncCounters.ptr`, `offset_ptr` result) in a new
`DeviceBuffer(ctx, ptr, …, owning=False)` just to memset or launch. Pass the
original buffer as an argument instead.
Do **not** “fix” anything with `@__parameter`.

## Safety rules

- Key bulk edits off the **value-argument name**, not every def with that name
- Do not bulk-replace capture lists (destroys `{mut count}` etc.)
- `name[i] =` inside `with … as name` is a local, not an outer `mut` capture
- Zero `@__parameter` / `@parameter` on nested closures in migrated code
- Lift a capture to an argument **only** for origin exclusivity (or the
  documented `{}` helper around an imm `DeviceBuffer` param)
- Stay NFC: do not change allocation lifetime, comptime vs dynamic layouts, or
  host work on the timed path. `comptime if` arm locals (buffers, host copies,
  `TileTensor`s, `row_major[M, N]()` layouts) stay in that arm — a size-1 alloc
  at function scope is a semantic change. Layouts built once (`a_shape`) stay
  outside `call_fn`
